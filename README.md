# Prodigy_Task_5
# 🚦 Accident Data Analysis & Visualization

This repository contains data analysis and visualization projects focused on identifying patterns in accident data. It includes interactive map-based visualizations and detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python.

## 📁 Contents

### 1. `accident_hotspots_map.html`
- An interactive heatmap generated using **Folium** and **Leaflet.js**.
- Visualizes accident-prone areas based on geographic coordinates.
- Can be viewed directly in any web browser.

### 2. `prodigy_Task4.ipynb`
- A Jupyter Notebook demonstrating EDA on accident-related data.
- Includes data cleaning, visualization (using matplotlib and seaborn), and insight extraction.
- Shows a foundational approach to data analysis with Python.

### 3. `Prodigy_Task5.ipynb`
- A continuation or advanced task focused on deeper data analysis.
- May include correlation analysis, trend visualization, or predictive elements depending on task structure.
- Demonstrates structured and professional use of data science tools.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- numpy
- folium (for map generation)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### To view the map:
1. Open `accident_hotspots_map.html` in a web browser.

### To run the notebooks:
1. Install required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy folium
    ```
2. Open `prodigy_Task4.ipynb` or `Prodigy_Task5.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or VS Code.
